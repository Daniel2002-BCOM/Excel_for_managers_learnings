It demonstrates the transition from fundamental data manipulation to complex automated financial systems and predictive modeling.

🚀 Key Skill Areas
📊 Business Intelligence & Dashboards

Dynamic Dashboards: Created interactive reporting tools using Slicers, Pivot Tables, and Pivot Charts to visualize company-wide variable costs.


Advanced Visualization: Built specialized charts including Thermometer Charts, Bullet Charts, and Dynamic Linked Legend Charts controlled by developer checkboxes.


Conditional Reporting: Implemented Icon Sets (circles/arrows) and conditional formatting to highlight performance metrics like Rank and Progress.

💰 Financial & Decision Modeling

Loan Amortization: Developed automated EMI calculators and full repayment schedules using the PMT function.


Investment Analysis: Calculated investment returns and profitability using IRR and XIRR formulas.


What-If Analysis: Utilized Goal Seek and Data Tables to perform scenario analysis for tax modeling and interest earned over 20-year periods.


Depreciation Modeling: Applied SLN and DB functions for asset management.

⚙️ Automation & VBA (Macros)

Process Automation: Recorded and refined Macros to automate standard statistical measures like Standard Deviation and Mean across large arrays.


VBA Scripting: Implemented custom VBA-coded Command Buttons to create user-driven search functions within datasets.


Iterative Logic: Enabled Circular References and iterative calculations to model complex financial scenarios where variables are mutually dependent.

📈 Statistical Analysis

Regression Analysis: Performed Multiple Regression using the Data Analysis Toolpak to identify coefficients and "Best Fit" lines for pricing data.


Descriptive Statistics: Generated comprehensive statistical summaries, including ANOVA and Residual outputs.

🛠 Technical Excel Mastery

Advanced Lookups: Mastered data retrieval using VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, and OFFSET.


Array Formulas: Leveraged CSE (Ctrl+Shift+Enter) array concepts to perform multi-criteria calculations, such as summing sales by specific agent and product.


Logic & Strings: utilized complex string functions (LEN, MID, LEFT, RIGHT) and nested IF statements for robust data cleaning.
